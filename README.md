# WriteUps2022Challenge

- Start day: Jan. 15,2022 (Try to catch up missing days if you can)
- Write one writeup of ANYTHING even if its on your library already if you think you can elaborate it or can add more to it!
- Doesn't matter if it is a content that is already in TryHackMe or whatever cyber range it is as long as you try to use your own words to explain it and elaborate it clearly and try to dive deep into it!
