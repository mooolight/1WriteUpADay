# Create a script/code to automatically calculate list of memory addresses so you don't have to manually calculate stuff every time.
Example Inputs:
1. LHS = rbp
2. RHS = 0x320
3. Operation = '-'

Total = Calculating the address of [rbp-0x320], [rbp-0x314],[rbp-0x310],etc.
Then, the output should give me a list of addresses with its corresponding name!
